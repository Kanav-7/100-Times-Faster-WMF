## Fast Weighted Median Filtering

The main goal of the project is to perform weighted median filtering of a given image in an efficient manner. The time complexity of original weighted median filtering (WMF) is O(r^2), where r is the size of the kernel. In our project, we will reduce this complexity to O(r) making it 100+ times faster than general method.
